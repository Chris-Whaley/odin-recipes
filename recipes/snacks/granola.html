    <h1>Granola</h1>
    <img src="granola.jpg" alt="picture of granola">
    <p>Homemade granola is rather easy when it comes to ingredients, but is a bit
        trickier when you're looking to replicate that store-bought brand you love. One
        of the finer points of a good granola is the satisfying crunch that some great
        brands have.</p>
    <p>We'll replicate this crunch by adding some enhancements to most granola recipes,
        cooking at a lower temperature for a longer period of time, and letting the granola
        cool on the sheet pan to form those delicious, crunchy clumps.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups rolled or old-fashioned oats</li>
            <li>1.5 cups chopped or diced pecans</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt</li>
            <li>.5 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>.5 cup melted coconut oil</li>
            <li>.5 cup maple syrup or honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 egg whites</li>
            <li>optional: .5 cup chocolate chips after granola cools</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and line a large, rimmed baking
                sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the oats, nuts, salt and cinnamon. Stir 
                to blend.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg whites until they get frothy</li>
            <li>Pour in the oil, maple syrup, vanilla, and egg whites. Mix well,
                until all oats are lightly coated.</li>
            <li>Pour granola onto parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake until lightly golden, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove baking sheet, and allow granola to cool on sheet. Don't stir!</li>
            <li>Once cool, pour granola and chocolate chips into storage container.</li>
        </ol>
